Goals
=====

Primary goals

* What is the minimum star formation rate visible to MICADO for a what size
  galaxies at what redshift?

Secondary goals

* At which redshift will MICADO no longer be able to determine the spatial
  distribution of the star formation in early universe galaxies?
* Which filters will MICADO be able to use to determine the star formation
  properties of high-z galaxies?
* How long will MICADO need to observe to determine the star formation for
  which SFR at which redshift?
