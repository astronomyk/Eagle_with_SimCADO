Theory of star formation at high-z
----------------------------------
* What are galaxies doing at high-z
* Why is it interesting to know the SFR of galaxies at high-z
    * Madau plot
    * So that we can determine how galaxies were built up over cosmic time

* How to determine star formation rate


Cosmological simulations
------------------------

* EAGLE produced a bunch of galaxies for different redshift snapshots
* The galaxies can be put through a radiative transfer code to generate IFU
  cubes, which can then be viewed by SimCADO to make "observation" of the
  galaxies
* We can observe the galaxies with different filters to determine the SFR
* Given MICADOs amazing resolution (~100pc/pix @ z=2), we might be able to
  observe the spatial extend of the star formation in galaxies at high-z



We can also observe a galaxy over it's history
